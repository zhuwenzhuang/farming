# Agent List State Protocol

> Chinese version: [agent-list-state-protocol.zh_cn.md](./agent-list-state-protocol.zh_cn.md)

The Farming backend owns the authoritative Agent list and its list-level
metadata. Browser interfaces consume that state through a snapshot plus delta
protocol; they do not reconstruct missing state from terminal or Chat traffic.

An initial connection, explicit resynchronization, or recovery from delivery
backpressure receives a complete snapshot. Later list changes carry complete
summaries only for changed Agents, removed Agent IDs, and changed list-level
metadata. Terminal output, Chat transcript changes, previews, and activity
updates remain on their Agent-scoped streams.

Every snapshot and delta identifies the backend generation and an increasing
sequence. A client applies only the next sequence in its current generation.
After a restart, sequence gap, or uncertain delivery, it requests a fresh
authoritative snapshot instead of guessing, replaying mutations, or requiring
per-message acknowledgements.
